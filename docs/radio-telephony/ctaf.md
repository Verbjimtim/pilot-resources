> Basic rule (CASR 91.325)
During a flight, a flight crew member must maintain vigilance, so far as weather
conditions permit, to see and avoid other aircraft.

> Right-of-way rules (CASR 91.330)
When taking evasive action because of a collision risk with another aircraft, you
must follow the right-of-way rules shown in the following table.

**Table:** Right-of-way rules

| Item | Circumstance | Right-of-way rule |
| ---- | ------------ | ----------------- |
| 1 | An aircraft is in an emergency and compelled to land. | All aircraft must give way to the aircraft compelled to land |
| 2 | An aircraft is landing | Any other aircraft (weather in flight or operating on ground or water) must give way to the landing aircraft |
| 3 | Two heavier-than-air aircraft are on approach to land at an aerodrome | > Higher one must give way to lower. > **However**, if the higher aircraft is in the final stages of an approach to land, the lower aircraft must not take advantage of the higher aircraft's requirement to give way. > Power driven aircraft must give way to an unpowered glider. |
| 4 | An aircraft is over taking another aircraft | The Overaking aircraft must give way to the aircraft being overtaken. |
| 5 | An aircraft is in the vicinity | The following shows right-of-way in descending order: 1. Ballon 2. Parachute descent 3. Unpowered glider 4. Airship 5. an aircraft towing something (including another aircraft) 6. Power-driven aircraft | 

!!! IMPORTANT
    Code of conduct states
    > B6 No flight may declare itself to have priority over another. Pilots are permitted to declare in-flight emergencies only when under air traffic control. If, for any reason, air traffic control requests the pilot to terminate the emergency, then the pilot must do so IMMEDIATELY or disconnect from the network.
