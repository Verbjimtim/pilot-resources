## Fuel Emergencies

Minimum fuel is a statment that inform the controller that due to the past delays, based on the current flight plan they will land at or slightly above minimum legal landing fuel. This inform the controller that they cannot afford to give you any delays (how ever on the vatsim network the controller may still give you delays and it up to you to ensure you do not run out of fuel.

- MAYDAY FUEL

Informs the controller that your current route will cause you to land with fuel bellow the legal minimums. This will usually be followed with diversion information by the flight crew.
