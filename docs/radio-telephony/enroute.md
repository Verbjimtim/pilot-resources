## contact Station on FREQ

When being asked to contact another sector, readback should look like the following:

`Contact [Station] on [FREQ] [Callsign]` (you may add a note of goodbye or thanks how ever NOT recomended in events)

### First contact with new station.
They will be expecting you! unless they are your departure freq after leaving tower, all you have to say is:

`[Station] [Callsign] Gday/Hello`

IF they are your first airborn controller (anything above a tower) you need to inform them what Altitude you are passing to the nearest 100ft. and If assigned to fly a heading that heading.

example on SY3 departure with assigned heading 170 and you call as you pass A023 cleared climb A050: `Sydney Approach Qantas zero six seven, climbing two tousand tree hundred on climb fife tousand`

## Controlled Airspace

### Strar clearance

Star clearances is what you use to get from your route to the landing runway. You are encouraged to think about you STAR once reaching cruise for Top of Descent planning. 

the star clearance from Center will sound as such: 

**Center**:`[Callsign], Star clearance, Cleared [STAR] arrival, runway [RWY], [Altitude instrucitons]`

**You**:`Cleared [STAR] Arrival, Runway [RWY], [Altitude instructions], [Callsign]`

request to plan for a different approach (therefore ammded star)? This is only for changing from the cleared star

**You**:`[Callsign], request [Ammended STAR] for [ammended Approach]`

## Weather avoidance/amended tracking requests

### Route deviation

**You**:`Request to deviate up to [distance] miles [left/right] of route due [reason]`

### Reroute request

**You on center**:`"Center [Callsign] Request"`

**Center on Center**:`"[Callsign] Go ahead"`

**You on Center**:`"Request ammended routing [new routing]"`

## Amended level requests

**You on Center/APP**:`"[Station] [Callsign] Request"`

**Station on Center/APP**:`"[Callsign go ahead]"`

**You on Center or APP**:`"[Callsign] Request ammended 

## Cleared to leave control area?

APP or Center may say `"[Callsign] clear to leave control area [instruction], [traffic info], [QNH]"`

So now we've gotta respond

### On Decent

Readback:**You on Center/APP** `"Clear to leave control area on decent [extra instructions], Copy the traffic, [QNH] [Callsign]"`

This simply gives you the freedom to decend on your present track/routing till you clear of CTA then operate as required from there.

### Direct / via

Readback:**You on Center/APP** `"Clear to leave control area [instructions], copy the traffic, [QNH], [Callsign]"`
