## Airways Clearance
### Standard airways clearance format

**IFR**

Request:`"[Station (Tower/Ground/Delivery/Approach/Center)] [Callsign] for [Destniation] Request clearance"` 

##### note, if the controller is a Center or approach, it's suggested you specify what airport you are in, especially if you are not at their primary airport.

Clearance: `"[Callsign] cleared to [Destniation] via [First point] Flight planed route Runway [Identifier] [Standard instrument departure] departure, climb via the SID [Alt] Squawk [Code] Departures [Freq]"`

Readback: `"Cleared to [Destniation] Via [First point] Flight planed route, Runway [Indentifier] [SID] departure, climb via the sid [ALT] Squawk [Code], Departures [Freq], bay [Bay number] **[Callsign]"`

**VFR**

Request:`"[Station (Tower/Ground/Delivery/Approach/Center)] [Callsign] for [Destniation] Request clearance"`

##### note, if the controller is a Center or approach, it's suggested you specify what airport you are in, especially if you are not at their primary airport.

Clearance:`"[Callsign] cleared [destination] via [First point]/Direct, runway [Identifier] climb/not above [ALT] Departures [Freq]"`

Readback:`"Cleared [Destination] Via [First point]/Direct, Runway [Identifier] Climb/Not above [ALT] Departures [Freq]"`

**Circuits**

Request:`"[Station (Tower/Ground/Delivery/Approach/Center)] [Callsign] [Aircraft type] [Bay] [number] People on board, for circuits"`
##### Controller may tell you to stand by as they co-ordinate with other controllers on things like altitude, runway and circuit direction

Clearance:`"[Callsign] cleared to operate in the circuit area runway [Identifier] [circuit direction of applicable] not above [Alt] squawk [code]"`

### PDC

You may recive a PDC at any time with out requesting it, OR you may request a PDC on freq with the following phraseology

`" [Callsign] for [Destniation] Request PDC"`

After you recived a PDC you are required to read it back on the specified freq. FIRST inform the controller you have a PDC readback so they can be ready to check it.

`"[Station (Tower/Ground/Delivery/Approach/Center)] [Callsign] with PDC readback"`

When the controller says:`"[Callsign] go ahead"`

Readback:`"[SID],Bay [Number], [Squawk]"`
